# E-Commerce Back End ORM

## Description

This challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Working with Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This challenge help me learn where to divide folder for the application. I learn how to use Insomnia how to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. I learn how to use sequelize with express.js. I learn how to divide models and how to use routes.
